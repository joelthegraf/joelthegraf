# Hi, I'm Joel 👋🏼

**I am a 3rd year IT apprentice from Switzerland.**

I'm currently doing an apprenticeship at Swisscom where I have the possibility to switch to different projects and gain a lot of knowledge.
Beside during my apprenticeship I also like to gain knowledge while working on private projects.
In my freetime I like to surf on the Aare (a river in Switzerland), work on my car, go to the gym, ski in snowparks and hangout with my friends.

## Skills 🔧

- Go, JavaScript, Python, Java, Groovy and some more
- Docker, Kubernetes
- Jenkins, ArgoCD, Camunda
- Linux, VIM
- Application Security

Feel free to ask me about them 😎.
